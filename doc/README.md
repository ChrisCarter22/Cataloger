# Cataloger Documentation

This `/doc` tree captures the product-facing documentation for the Cataloger project. Agent-specific rules still live in `Agents.md`; the files below focus on describing the application itself.

## Document Map
- [ProductOverview.md](ProductOverview.md) – product goals, core characteristics, user workflows, and UI behaviors.
- [SystemArchitecture.md](SystemArchitecture.md) – layered architecture, catalog schema, and repository/module layout.
- [Pipelines.md](Pipelines.md) – preview/zoom pipeline, ingest engine, metadata templates, and FTP uploader details.
- [BuildTestingDeployment.md](BuildTestingDeployment.md) – toolchains, strict build/test rules, security constraints, and deployment targets.

Keep these documents synchronized with the source code; every architectural or workflow change should be reflected here.
